							</p>
							<p>Round 1:</br> 
							Round 1 is the prepared round. Each school team (comprising of 5 actors) will have to choose any of the topics listed below and they would hence have to prepare a group skit of no more than 5 minutes portraying this topic. The key is to refrain from using the name or any obvious synonyms of the topic in the skit. A Total 10 schools will be participating. </br> 
							Topics for Round 1 are: </br> 
							Suspense </br> 
							Salvation </br> 
							Irony </br> 
							Karma</br> 
							Growth of an individual </br> 
							Along with the other judging criteria, the judges will be asked to guess the topic (theme) of each team. If the judges are correctly able to guess the team's topic, the team will be awarded with bonus points. </br> 
							</p>
							<p>The judging criteria are as follows:</br> 
							Creativity  </br> 
							Stage presence  </br> 
							Expression</br> 
							Accuracy to topic(if judges guess the right topic bonus points allotted)</br> 
							</p>
							<p>Rules and regulations:</br> 
							There will be a list of synonyms written along with the respective topics which are not allowed to be used in the course of the play</br> 
							Negating the antonyms of the topic are also not allowed and both these scenarios will lead to deduction of points.</br> 
							The storyline of the script should not be based of an obvious/popular novel,movie or short story.i.e..the script should present an original idea.</br> 
							</p>
							<p>Round 2 :</br> 
							Round 2 is the improv round. From the 10 initial participating teams, only 5 will advance to the this round.  </br> 
							The team of 5 will be given a pre-made situation to act out, 30 minutes before their performance. The characters for this situation should be taken up by only 4 of the 5 actors. They then get to decide how to play their characters and bring out the situation in their own way. The 1 remaining actor will be given their role right before the performance without the knowledge of the rest of their team of what role they play. </br> 
							Hence during the course of the performance, the fifth actor steps into the act after an introduction by the hosts(us) at the 2 minute mark with a new twist to the situation given by us. They then have to continue the act for another 2 minutes. </br> 
							The main role of the actors is to deal with the entrance of the new character as comfortably as possible. And there should be no disturbance in the flow of the act.</br> 
							</p>
							<p>The situations are:</br> 
							Not another family feud! </br> 
							A child comes home with bad marks and the parents scold the child. Their scolding eventually turns into an argument amongst themselves as each parent blames the other for spoiling the child.

							Actor vs character! </br> 
							An arrogant and egotistical actor boasts about how well he acts to everyone at a press conference about a character he played in a recent popular film. ENTER the character he played in a human form scolding him for being vain, but the actor is the only one who can see the character, so, to the press he looks like a maniac talking to the air… </br>
